Encapsulation: Separating interface from implementation.                                                                                

Methods: Properties that hold function values   
(object.method())  

Prototype: Is another object that is used as a fallback source of properties.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 from implementation
